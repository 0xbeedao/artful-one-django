# Personal blog site code for Artful.One

Based largely on [Simon Willison's Blog](https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog)

## Development

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage the development environment. To get started, make sure you have Nix installed with flakes enabled.

Then, to enter the development shell, run:

```bash
nix develop
```

This will provide you with a shell that has Python, Node.js, bun, and all the project dependencies available.
