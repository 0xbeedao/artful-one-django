<h2>About me</h2>

<p>TBD: Need short bio here.</p>

<p>You can subscribe to my blog using Atom feeds or by following me on Twitter.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="atom">Atom feeds</h3>

<p>The main feed for my site combines my blog entries, my blogmarks and my collected quotations:</p>

<p><code>https://artful.one/atom/everything/</code></p>

<p>If you just want my longer form blog entries you can subscribe to this feed instead:</p>

<p><code>https://artful.one/atom/entries/</code></p>

<p>Or this feed for just my links (excluding quotes):</p>

<p><code>https://artful.one/atom/links/</code></p>

<p>Every <a href="/tags/">tag</a> on my blog has its own feed. You can subscribe to those by adding <code>.atom</code> to the URL to the tag page.</p>

<p>For example, to subscribe to just my content about ai, use the following:</p>

<p><code>https://artful.one/tags/ai.atom</code></p>

<h3 id="disclosures">Disclosures</h3>

{% filter markdownify %}
I do not receive any compensation writing about specific topics on this blog - no sponsored content! I plan to continue this policy. If I ever change this I will disclose that both here and in the post itself.

I provide ad-hoc consulting and training services to a number of different companies and organizations. If any of those represent a conflict of interest with my writing here I will disclose that in the relevant post.
